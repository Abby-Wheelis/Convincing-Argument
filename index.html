<h1>Making a Convinving Argument</h1>
    
    <h2>Environmental Conservation</h2>
        <p>A common misconception about environmental conservation is that an individual’s actions have no power to make a difference because they are not impactful enough.This leads to people not making an effort to exercise conservation in their everyday lives, which actually does have the potential to contribute signifigantly towards an improvement. </p>
    
    
    <h2>Important Considerations</h2>
        <p>When making a convincing argument to disprove this misconception, I want to make sure that I focus on the facts, as opposed to stating the myth, and warn the reader before I bring up the myth. For example, I should title the effort “things you can do to save the environment” as opposed to “the myth that small personal changes can’t save our planet.” In this way, I can work to avoid the backfire effect, which may simply strengthen someone’s belief that they can’t make a difference as opposed to reinforcing the idea that they can create change. When including graphics in my argument, I should strive to improve the adequacy of the fit and the ease of interpretation so as to effectively display the information. Some ways that I could increase the depth and breadth of my model would possibly be to include the time it takes for things to decompose or how much waste is consumer generated. These increases in bredth and/or depth may allow me to further my own understanding of the issue and also to allow the reader to better interpret the scenario. </p>
